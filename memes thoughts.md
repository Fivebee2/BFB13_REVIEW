## MEMES' THOUGHTS

  First off, this doesn't seem like it would take this long to complete one BFB episode. I thought they forgot about BFB and were gonna do a BFDIA where they just stop and forget about it for years upon end. I'm glad that Ice Cube wants to change teams, and escape from Book (Dictionary) choosing decisions for Ice Cube without her input, but Ice Cube can't change teams because you aren't allowed to in this season.

  👏 CAKE 👏 AT 👏 STAKE 👏 REVIEW. So, this Cake at Stake could have been slower in my opinion, I was shocked when Firey Jr. got eliminated with 10,000 votes which I think is this most ever in the history of BFDI.
